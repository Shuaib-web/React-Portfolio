Being a web developer means being part of a community. I’ll need a place not only to share my projects while  applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.
My task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
